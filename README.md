The heroes are called to look into the matter of some suspicious events occurring at a neighbour’s farm.  There, they discover that there is a supernatural cause. While trying to solve the matter, they are brought face-to-face with a powerful, monstrous foe from beyond the world of the living!

'The Cursed Farm' is a demo scenario that introduces Age of Vikings, our new roleplaying game of adventuring in Iceland in the year 977 AD, the era of the Icelandic sagas. Players are heroes, landowners trying to earn fame and glory in a world full of magic, monsters, and myth!

Welcome to the Age of Vikings, where you are transported to medieval Iceland—a vibrant land on the edge of the known world, where Vikings seek honor and fame through adventure.
